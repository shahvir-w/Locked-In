# Locked In

Struggling to get things done!? Having a hard time staying consistent!? Then, Locked In is the right app for you!

Locked In is a mobile application created using React Native. It is a task completion 
tracker that gives you a score out of 100 based on the number of tasks you complete and the number of days you
complete them. It basically determines if you are "Locked In" or not ðŸ˜…!

## Description

Tasks are duplicated from the day before. Tasks can also be added or deleted, and a complete history of previous tasks can be viewed.
Light theme and Dark theme are available!
